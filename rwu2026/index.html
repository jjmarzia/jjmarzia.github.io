    <h1>Letter to the Presidential Search Committee</h1>
    <div class="meta">
      From: Joseph Marziale
    </div>

    <p>
      Hello,
    </p>

    <p>
      My name is Joseph J. Marziale (RWU Math BS ’22, Physics BS ’22, Varsity Men’s Soccer, Miner Hall RA), and I am
      defending the dissertation for my PhD in Aerospace Engineering in the division of Computational and Applied
      Mechanics from the University at Buffalo in December 2025. I am 24 years old with a fast-paced research output
      in computational physics (<a href="https://buffalo.edu/~jjmarzia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://buffalo.edu/~jjmarzia</a>)
      and I have government experience in the Department of Energy as a member of Los Alamos National Laboratory’s
      computational science division (CCS-2).
    </p>

    <p>
      Though not one-to-one with the typical responsibilities of a university President, I am telling you about my
      background in academia because I feel it is what informs my desire to apply for the Presidency. By this I mean
      I am delighted about the success I have enjoyed in the research community due to my Roberts education, but am
      concerned that this quality of the institution, that it has the potential to produce elite critical thinkers
      with a liberal arts foundation in classical literature + Free Methodist theology, is underutilized and at worst
      forgotten about entirely. Like other alumni I have followed the headlines as Roberts scales its graduate
      programs, then advertises certificate programs, then discovers the trades, then decides it must right-size due
      to bloat. From the outside looking in, many believers in Roberts’s mission according to its founding* are
      concerned that these changes are transient reactionary steps to try to adapt to modernity. To this I would say
      I understand this desire to conform, but worry that conformity will lead us to the destiny of the median 21st
      century university, where the ability to learn practically anything online calls the necessity of these
      institutions into question. In this context I imagine that the RIZE integration program and the previous
      Community Institutes certification effort was an attempt to gatekeep the accreditation process. However,
      without a firm position in the research and development space of our own, we become indistinguishable as
      accreditors to any other institution, and I believe we will fail to compete against other accreditors that are
      not accountable to the funding of large buildings, athletic teams, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      For these reasons I believe that who the survival of universities depends on is the same today as always: the
      professors, their research, and the courses only they have the academic background to offer. I believe having
      clarity on this is the answer to how to navigate the future, because it defines the manner in which we can truly
      excel and not just conform. We cannot forget we are the original standard-bearers of Free Methodist thought;
      therefore we are well equipped to stand out as a national force in American Christendom and its churches and
      seminaries. I believe setting Roberts’s destiny in the direction of its historical strengths ensures not only
      its continued existence, but its unprecedented growth. By this I mean that the majority of Roberts students hail
      from local towns, but Christianity is a heritage that we, by having the courage to become influential academic
      contributors to it, could share abundantly with our entire nation, whose smart young people burn in their desire
      to know Christ.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe it is the trajectory of my life to become an academic authority and advocate for Christ, and I want
      Roberts to share in this destiny. Therefore I hope you will consider this email as my formal interest in the
      position of the Presidency. My email is <a href="mailto:jjmarzia@buffalo.edu">jjmarzia@buffalo.edu</a>.
